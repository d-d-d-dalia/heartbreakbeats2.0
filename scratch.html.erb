1. from user song index page, have a more button that makes more songs in the list appear. (also, remove vibes from this page)

	here i'm going to use javascript to call /songs where the serialized objects live and deliver them to the user song index page

	*didn't use more button, but completed this
	
2. next and previous buttons to flip thru show pages.

3. isn't this taken care of by 2?

4. on flip-thru-able show pages, the edit button would magic transform the page into edit form and there would be a save button as well to magic edit the song show page

5. no idea
