1. from user song index page, have a more button that makes more songs in the list appear. (also, remove vibes from this page)
2. next and previous buttons to flip thru show pages.

4. on flip-thru-able show pages, the edit button would magic transform the page into edit form and there would be a save button as well to magic edit the song show page
5. no idea
