1. from user song index page, have a more button that makes more songs in the list appear. (also, remove vibes from this page)

	here i'm going to use javascript to call /songs where the serialized objects live and deliver them to the user song index page

	*didn't use more button, but completed this
	
2. next (and previous) button to flip thru show pages.

3. isn't this taken care of by 2?
(D Martinez: "and for #3, you'd have to be able to render the has many resource in the same AJAX call (as opposed to two different ones like we did first)")

just make sure to use serializer in order to render vibe data

4. on flip-thru-able show pages, the edit button would magic transform the page into edit form and there would be a save button as well to magic edit the song show page

5. no idea

(D Martinex "yeah, that's the main focus of requirement #5 - building JS model objects with at least one method on the prototype from the AJAX responses")

this can happen in any one ajax req. it could also be for all of them, esp if i'm dealing with song data throughout.

J:
use a constructor and the constructor will construct JS objects
have to make a class
all of the JSON responses need to be in the form of model objects where you use a constructor
