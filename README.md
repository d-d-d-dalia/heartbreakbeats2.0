Overview

Heartbreakbeats is a rails app that was created in the aftermath of some breakup(s), in the spirit of cathartic processing. The app enables users to document songs with lyrical content dealing with pain and loss in romantic love. Users can also associate "vibes" with each song and attribute a level for each vibe from 1-5. Heartbreakbeats is meant as an alternative to genre categorization, and re-focusses attention on a song's sentiment(s), and the emotions those sentiments elicit in us as heartbroken listeners.
